*Note* Made with just `python 1 day` of efforts so please ignore minor (if you can find any üòè) details or miss.

## Why i created this project? 
- Made for an assignment. 

## Features
- It is a Netflix Home page - India -clone.
- I did a pretty good job compare for yourself [Original](https://www.netflix.com/in/) with [My Clone](https://mayank-jain-1.github.io/Netflix-Homepage.github.io/)
- Made with some help of Bootstrap (I prefer not to use. But for the assignment. )

## Things i learnt
- Learnt more into Boostrap grid structures and other stuff.
- Really loved the Video moving in the Tv Screens effect. Would love to use them again in other projects.
